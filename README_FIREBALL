Instalation:
1. cd src; make clean; make
2  cd tools; make clean; make

run:
cd work


./builder.com l_loc

where l_loc is local part of PP (0..s;1..p etc. )
leaving l_loc blank the code uses d-component as local part
Optinonally, you can preform each step of generation separately taking 
more controll over the generation process:

a) ./psgen *.ini
b) ./pswatch *.ini  -l $l_loc
c) ../tools/linear.x
d) ../tools/qlqgrid.x
e) ../tools/mk_pseudoFile.x

for more details about the usage of the code see documentation of 
fhi98PP package (http://www.fhi-berlin.mpg.de/th/fhi98md/fhi98PP/)
